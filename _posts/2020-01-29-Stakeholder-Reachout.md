This week I spent time reaching out to promising contacts and conducted more research pertaining to Project Saturn.

# Stakeholder Reachout

Last week I had trouble compiling a large list of "stakeholders" that I could contact. So this week I spent longer than I expected finding people I could reachout to and discuss Project Saturn.

<!--more-->

I ended up reaching out to three educators and two contacts associated with game development.

## Three Educators

The educators I reached out to have some variance. One teaches/has taught a money management class at a local high school, one teaches business classes at my alma mater high school (which doesn't have a personal finance class), and one teaches a college level course on video games and education.

<!--more-->

I'm hoping that I can hold an interview with all three and be able to gain new information from each based on these variances.

## Two Contacts Related to Game Development

First I contacted the creator of *The Oregon Trail* since that is a very successful game and taught lessons in the subject of US History.

<!--more-->

Second I contacted a Michigan game studio called Protégé Game Studios. They specialize in creating video games that contain rich interactive learning experiences. 

# More Research

My inspiration for Project Saturn was the fact that my high school never offered a class that specialized in personal finance. Therefore many of the lessons I aim to teach through Project Saturn I must learn myself. I struggled to find academic papers that covered the topics I'm trying to teach. I am still working on finding good sources.

# Teachnical Demos

Unfortunately, due to other class work and a career fair I did not have enough time this week to conduct a technical demo.

<!--more-->

However, I have two ideas for technical demos that I will be looking to execute later this week. 

<!--more-->

Through last weeks research I found that an important aspect of educational games used in classrooms is being able to save progress in the case that one class period is not enough time to finish the game. I started looking at Unity documentation on how to save a game state and load it at a future date. I will be experimenting with this next week.

<!--more-->

Another demo I would like to create is creating some achievement based system that highlights topics learned in the game. I think something like this would help force learning experiences by highlighting material taught in the game. 

# Conclusion

I'm hoping to hear back from contacts I reached out to find out the most important material that should be added to the game and the best methods to go about doing that.
