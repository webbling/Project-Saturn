I got to speak with Don Rawitsch, co-creator of *The Oregon Trail*.

<!--more-->

*The Oregon Trail* is a video game that was brought up in a Video Game Design lecture last semester. It's a very good example of an educational video game that teaches a targeted lesson. Therefore, I thought Mr. Rawitsch would be a great person to discuss educational game design with. Here's some of the questions I asked him. These responses are not recorded verbatim. 

#### Why choose a video to help teach a U.S. history lesson versus some other activity?

- In 1971 there was little opportunity for computer based school activities. *The Oregon Trail* was originally going to be a board game. Ultimately it ended up being a computer game once Rawitsch partnered up with Paul Dillenberger and Bill Heinemann, the other two co-creators. Rawitsch believed that some of the concepts of *The Oregon Trail* would be hard to convey in a board game.

#### Do you still feel video games can be alternatives for classroom lectures? Have video games progressed well since 1971?

- Mr. Rawitsch still believes that computer applications are great methods of education when used properly. Computer applications create more opportunities for learning and some things can't be done without them. They are good methods to create learning-centric environments.

#### How did your supervisors/other staff at the school react when you decided to teach this lesson with a video game?

- His direct supervisor was an older gentleman who more or less said, "go ahead and try it". Video games weren't really a thing in 1971 despite us considering *The Oregon Trail* a video game. It's better classified as a text-based simulation on a teletype.

#### Your development process for *The Oregon Trail* was only two weeks long. What was that process like?

- The group of three were very excited about the project and it never felt like a chore. The worked on it on weeknights and heavily on the weekends. Mr. Rawitsch even admitted to "kidnapping" a teletype from the school to speed up development.

#### Did you ever feel like the game was over-scoped? Did you want to add more?

- The original version of the game was only 800 lines of code. They didn't try to oversimplify the game. They valued all of the events added to the game becaused they only added to the simulation of being on the actual Oregon Trail. He did mention wanting to add a POV of a Native American to the game. Overall he was very happy with the product they created.

#### What are some of the ways you forced learning experiences for the students playing the game?

-  There are some basic things that were very easy to convey such as when events happened. Because events in the game are somewhat random, it was a little hard to force certain experiences, but every unqiue experience helped teach about life on the Oregon Trail. The most interesting thing Mr. Rawitsch observed was how the students' stratgy evolved over time. Because of the limited number of teletypes at the school, group sessions to play the game was required. Initially the sessions were choatic and created heated debates about the best action to take in the game. Unprompted, the sessions evolved to be much more democratic. Students seperated tasks by game mechanic expertise and valued the opinions/input of others in the group.

#### A lot of schools, especially in the U.S., like to see results or proof of learning. How did you accompish this with *The Oregon Trail*?

- Mr. Rawitsch couldn't exactly remember. He's sure that at some point he gave a unit/chapter test about the Oregon Trail, but he didn't give students a test after playing the game itself. Students did a lot of work on their own time in order to get better at the game. They read maps and read material related to things in the game. In general, he thinks game progression and some sort of level system would be a good way to tell how much the students understand.

#### What should every educational video game strive to implement?

- All educational games should have clear objectives that the player is trying to accomplish. In games like *The Oregon Trail* or a personal finance game, the player should have some resources that they're managing. There should be some sort of scoring or evaluation method. Storylines/narratives can be helpful to get a lesson accross. Mr. Rawitsch recalled a class he took in high school where all the students were given a economic profile and attributes. They had to make it through the year with their given resources. There were unexpected events, income taxes based on profile, etc. and these helped teach him some important economic concepts. 

#### Alternatively, what should every educational game avoid?

- Some obvious things such as poor instructions or poor art style. It's very important to not make the game too easy. The goal is to challenge the player so that when they do overcome the obstacle they've learned a lesson. He didn't try to alter the difficulty of *The Oregon Trail* too much. The probability of the random events created a game model that worked very well.

#### What do you think is the best genre for educational games?

- Mr. Rawitsch likes simulation games the best for teaching specific lessons because he thinks there is a lot of value in dropping a student in the middle of a situation and having them figure out how to succeed. He's not sure if there is a best genre because you might have a genre that appeals more to the material you're trying to teach than another. 

#### What is the best platform for a educational video game?

- He recognizes that other options besides computers exist, but still believes computers are the best option. 

#### Other Responses

More was said that didn't relate to a certain question. I'm placing those responses here.

- Mr. Rawitsch has seen some other personal finance projects. He thinks Project Saturn could make a real contribution to education.
- The traditional method of game design is to write up a design document, lay out resources, create a spreadsheet to show work progression, complete actions, test, etc. Mr. Rawitsch thinks there is value in a newer type of design that he dubs the "George Lucas Model" where you get an idea and start developing it immediately. While developing you might get more ideas that you end up incorporating.
- Sometimes when inventing/developing things people get caught up in the juice (not the word he used, "juice" is EECS 494 Video Game Design terminology). He thinks results are more important than making your game impressive visually. 
- Education seems to go through phases where some courses are more popular/pushed and others are forgotten. He thinks STEM classes has unintentionally replaced practical arts/personal finance/home economics courses. 
- Games are a great way to introduce a concept which can then be expanded on.
- He suggested I try to get a curriculum for a high school personal fiancne class to help with material for the game.

#### Conclusion

I'm glad I got to speak with Don Rawitsch. We had a great discussion about what makes a good educational video games and he gave a lot of insight that will certainly help this project.
