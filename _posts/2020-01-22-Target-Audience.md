"Higher Education" is a very broad audience however. The individuals in this sector best suited for Project Saturn are those who never recieved a formal personal finance education in their K-12 years.

Students in the higher education sector are typically taking out loans and holding university jobs. Having a resource like Project Saturn could prove very beneficial to them.

# High School Economics/Finance Educators

Project Saturn would be beneficial to economics/finance educators in the K-12 sector.

Topics like taxes, loans, bank accounts, and more are typically thought of as uninteresting topics to learn. Project Saturn could help teach high school students some of these important personal finance topics before needing to use/apply them in an interesting way.
